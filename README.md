# Hardware

**A simple Skateboard** can be used for that, you donâ€™t need a specific one or build one from scratch (But you can if you want)

A skateboard is composed of a board, Trucks, Wheels and Bearings and a grip. You can find everything per piece or buy a skateboard pre-mounted.

## Motorisation

You can fin two systems of motorisation :
- Pulley Motor : A motor drives a pulley which drives a wheel
- Motor Wheel : The motor is located directly inside the wheel

### Pulley Motor

A motor drives a pulley which drives a wheel. It is an apparent system located under the skateboard or at the back of the skateboard
