# Hardware

**A simple Skateboard** can be used for that, you don’t need a specific one or build one from scratch (But you can if you want)
A skateboard is composed of a board, Trucks, Wheels and Bearings and a grip. You can find everything per piece or buy a skateboard pre-mounted.

## Motorisation

You can fin two systems of motorisation :
- Pulley Motor
- In-wheel Motor

### Pulley Motor

A motor drives a Belt which drives a wheel. It is an apparent system located under the skateboard or at the back of the skateboard unlike the in-wheel motor system where the motor is invisible. With this system, many components may need to be replaced after many uses. (Belt, Pulley, Motor). This system can be composed of one or two motors that can be modified, changed and improved.

| Component | Item Specifications |
| --- | --- |
| Motor | The motor must be a brushless motor. The power can vary and be calculated according to the desired maximum speed. The motors can be purchased on different specialized sites (https://www.mboards.co/collections/electric-skateboard-motors) or suppliers such as aliexpress.  The most common motors for electric skatboard projects are almost 200Kv brushless motors. The use of two motors instead of one does not increase the maximum speed but allows a faster speed increase |
| Belt | The belt seize depend your pulley, your mount and your wheel gear. It need to be purchased and you can’t do it yourself. Available in several sites and in all sizes like here : https://www.mboards.co/collections/pulleys-and-mounts |
| Motor Pulley | Can be Printed in 3D if the motor is not too heavy and the speed not too high. If you print it, do not use PLA and use a heat resistant material such as carbon filament. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2337126 Can be purchased on differents sites like here : https://www.mboards.co/collections/pulleys-and-mounts |
| Wheel Pulley | The size varies according to the diameter of your wheel. Can be Printed in 3D. If you print it, do not use PLA and use a heat resistant material such as carbon filament. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2337126 Can be purchased on many sites like here : https://www.mboards.co/collections/pulleys-and-mounts |
| Motor Mount | Can be Printed in 3D. If you print it, do not use PLA and use a heat resistant material such as carbon filament https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2429445/files Can be purchased on many sites like here : https://www.mboards.co/collections/pulleys-and-mounts |

### In-Wheel Motors

The motor is directly integrated to the rear wheels. This system is more aesthetic because you can't see the engine. However, the rear wheels are more complicated to change and the engine can be complicated to change in case of breakage or to improve without changing the whole wheel.
The use of two In-Wheel motors is preferable for this system unlike the pulley-motor which can be satisfied with a single motor.

| In-Wheel Motor | Can be found in many colors and seizes on differents sites like here : http://www.diyeboard.com/hub-motor-8352mm-450w-75kv-for-diy-electric-skateboard-p-536.html?zenid=ka8sls2lth4h54md18q2bsi2i0 |

### Electronic

Some electronic is required to use the electric skateboard.
